We're a large community focused around the Python programming language. We believe anyone can learn to code, and are very dedicated to helping novice developers take their first steps into the world of programming. We also attract a lot of expert developers who are seeking friendships, collaborators, and who wish to hone their craft by teaching and getting involved in the community.

We organise regular community events such as code jams, open-source hackathons, seasonal events, and community challenges. Through our sponsorships and donations, many of our events even have prizes to win!

You can find help with most Python-related problems in our help forum. Our staff of over 100 dedicated expert Helpers are available around the clock in every timezone. Whether you're looking to learn the language or working on a complex project, we've got someone who can help you if you get stuck.
